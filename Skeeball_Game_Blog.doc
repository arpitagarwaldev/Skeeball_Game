💻 CODE EXCELLENCE

Advanced Physics Integration:
```
function updateBall() {
    ball.x += ball.vx;
    ball.y += ball.vy;
    ball.vy += GRAVITY_CONSTANT;     // Realistic physics
    ball.vx *= FRICTION_COEFFICIENT; // Air resistance
    
    // Collision detection with spatial optimization
    const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    if (distance < targetRadius) processCollision();
}
```

Intelligent Auto-Aim System:
```
function updateAutoAim() {
    autoAim.angle += autoAim.speed * autoAim.direction;
    
    // Boundary detection with smooth reversal
    if (autoAim.angle > maxAngle || autoAim.angle < minAngle) {
        autoAim.direction *= -1;
    }
}
```

Performance-Optimized Rendering:
```
function gameLoop() {
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
    
    // Layered composition pipeline
